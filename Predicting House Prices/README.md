# Predicting House Prices

## Introduction
This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this analysis contains various features of houses such as area, number of bedrooms, location, etc., and their corresponding prices.

## Motivation
The primary motivation behind this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate house prices based on its features. This model can be valuable for real estate agents, homeowners, and potential buyers in making informed decisions about pricing and purchasing properties.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about various houses including their features and corresponding prices. It includes features such as:
- Area
- Number of bedrooms
- Location
- Age of the house
- etc.

The dataset is available in the `data` directory and is named `house_prices.csv`.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
