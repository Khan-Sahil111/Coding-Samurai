# Coding Samurai

## Introduction

Welcome to the Coding Samurai repository! This repository contains two projects aimed at exploring and analyzing different aspects of the real estate industry.

### Airbnb Listings

The "Airbnb Listings" project focuses on conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Airbnb listings data. The dataset used in this analysis contains information about Airbnb listings in Seattle, including details such as price, location, property type, and more. Through this analysis, we aim to gain insights into the Airbnb market, understand trends, and identify patterns that may be valuable for both hosts and guests.

### Predicting House Prices

The "Predicting House Prices" project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this analysis contains various features of houses, such as area, number of bedrooms, location, etc., along with their corresponding prices. The primary motivation behind this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate house prices based on its features. This model can be valuable for real estate agents, homeowners, and potential buyers in making informed decisions about pricing and purchasing properties.

Feel free to explore each project folder for more details, including code, data, and documentation.
