# Airbnb Listings Exploratory Data Analysis

## Introduction
This project focuses on conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Airbnb listings data using Python. The dataset used in this analysis contains information about Airbnb listings, including details such as price, location, property type, and more.

## Motivation
The primary motivation behind this project is to gain insights into the Airbnb market by exploring and visualizing the available data. Through this analysis, we aim to answer various questions about the listings, understand trends, and identify patterns that may be valuable for both hosts and guests.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from **[Seattle Airbnb Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle)**. It includes three csv files Calender, reviews, and listings. Our main focus is on listings which contains 3818 rows and 27 columns.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Analysis Overview
The EDA process involves the following steps:
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
2. Data Exploration
3. Statistical Analysis
4. Visualization of Insights

## Key Findings
